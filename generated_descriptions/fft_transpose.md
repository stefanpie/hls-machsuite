Description:
The `fft1D_512` kernel function implements a 1D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm for a 512-point input signal. The algorithm is based on the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm and is optimized for parallel execution on a GPU architecture. The kernel function takes two input arrays, `work_x` and `work_y`, each of size 512, representing the real and imaginary parts of the input signal, respectively. The function performs a series of complex multiplications, additions, and twiddle factor calculations to transform the input signal into the frequency domain.

Top-Level Function: `fft1D_512`

Inputs:
- `work_x`: an array of 512 `TYPE` elements representing the real part of the input signal
- `work_y`: an array of 512 `TYPE` elements representing the imaginary part of the input signal

Outputs:
- `work_x`: an array of 512 `TYPE` elements representing the real part of the output signal in the frequency domain
- `work_y`: an array of 512 `TYPE` elements representing the imaginary part of the output signal in the frequency domain

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `TYPE`: a data type representing a double-precision floating-point number
- `complex_t`: a struct representing a complex number with real and imaginary parts of type `TYPE`

Sub-Components:
- `twiddles8`: a function that calculates the twiddle factors for an 8-point FFT
- `FFT8`: a function that performs an 8-point FFT on a complex input signal
- `loadx8` and `loady8`: functions that load 8 complex numbers from an input array into a local array
- `FF2` and `FFT4`: functions that perform 2-point and 4-point FFTs, respectively, on a complex input signal
