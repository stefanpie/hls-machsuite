Description:
The `bbgemm` kernel is a high-performance implementation of the General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) algorithm, optimized for cache performance using a blocked algorithm. The design takes advantage of spatial locality by dividing the input matrices into smaller blocks, reducing memory access patterns and improving data reuse. The kernel performs a matrix-matrix multiplication operation, computing the product of two input matrices `m1` and `m2` and storing the result in the output matrix `prod`.

Top-Level Function: `bbgemm`

Inputs:
- `m1`: a 2D matrix of size `N x N` (where `N = row_size * col_size`) containing the first input matrix, stored in row-major order with each element of type `TYPE` (double precision floating-point).
- `m2`: a 2D matrix of size `N x N` containing the second input matrix, stored in row-major order with each element of type `TYPE` (double precision floating-point).

Outputs:
- `prod`: a 2D matrix of size `N x N` containing the product of the input matrices, stored in row-major order with each element of type `TYPE` (double precision floating-point).

Important Data Structures and Data Types:
- `TYPE`: a double precision floating-point data type, used to represent the elements of the input and output matrices.
- `block_size`: an integer constant defining the size of the blocks used in the blocked algorithm, set to 8.
- `row_size` and `col_size`: integer constants defining the size of the input matrices, set to 64.
- `N`: an integer constant representing the total number of elements in the input matrices, calculated as `row_size * col_size`.

Sub-Components:
- `loopjj` and `loopkk`: nested loops that iterate over the blocks of the input matrices, dividing the computation into smaller, cache-friendly chunks.
- `loopi` and `loopk`: inner loops that perform the actual matrix-matrix multiplication operation, iterating over the elements of the blocks.
- `loopj`: an inner loop that accumulates the partial products of the matrix-matrix multiplication operation.
