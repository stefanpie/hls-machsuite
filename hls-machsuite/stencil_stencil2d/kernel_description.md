## stencil_stencil2d

An implementation of a 2D stencil computation that applies a 3x3 filter to a 2D input array, producing a 2D output array. The kernel iterates over the input array, applying the filter to each element and its neighbors, and accumulates the results to produce the output array. The kernel is designed to perform a single iteration of the stencil computation.

Top-Level Function: `stencil`

Inputs:

- `orig`: a 2D array of `TYPE` (int32_t) elements, representing the input data, with a size of `row_size` x `col_size` (128x64).
- `sol`: a 2D array of `TYPE` (int32_t) elements, representing the output data, with a size of `row_size` x `col_size` (128x64).
- `filter`: a 1D array of `TYPE` (int32_t) elements, representing the 3x3 filter, with a size of `f_size` (9).

Outputs:

- `sol`: the output 2D array, with the same size and data type as the input `sol` array.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:

- `TYPE`: an alias for `int32_t`, representing the data type of the input and output arrays.
- `row_size` and `col_size`: constants defining the size of the input and output arrays.
- `f_size`: a constant defining the size of the filter array.

Sub-Components:

- The kernel consists of four nested loops: two outer loops iterating over the rows and columns of the input array, and two inner loops iterating over the elements of the filter. The inner loops perform the stencil computation, accumulating the results in a temporary variable `temp`.
- The kernel uses a temporary variable `mul` to store the product of the filter element and the corresponding input element.
- The kernel uses a label `stencil_label1` to `stencil_label4` to identify the loops and facilitate debugging and optimization.
