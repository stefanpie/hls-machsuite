## md_knn

An implementation of the molecular dynamics kernel, which computes the forces between atoms in a molecular system. The kernel is based on the Lennard-Jones potential and is optimized for parallel execution. The design takes into account the positions of atoms and their neighbors, calculates the distances and forces between them, and updates the forces accordingly.

Top-Level Function: `md_kernel`

Inputs:

- `force_x`: an array of `nAtoms` elements of type `TYPE` (double) representing the x-components of the forces on each atom.
- `force_y`: an array of `nAtoms` elements of type `TYPE` (double) representing the y-components of the forces on each atom.
- `force_z`: an array of `nAtoms` elements of type `TYPE` (double) representing the z-components of the forces on each atom.
- `position_x`: an array of `nAtoms` elements of type `TYPE` (double) representing the x-coordinates of each atom.
- `position_y`: an array of `nAtoms` elements of type `TYPE` (double) representing the y-coordinates of each atom.
- `position_z`: an array of `nAtoms` elements of type `TYPE` (double) representing the z-coordinates of each atom.
- `NL`: a 2D array of `nAtoms` x `maxNeighbors` elements of type `int32_t` representing the indices of the neighboring atoms for each atom.

Outputs:

- `force_x`: updated array of `nAtoms` elements of type `TYPE` (double) representing the x-components of the forces on each atom.
- `force_y`: updated array of `nAtoms` elements of type `TYPE` (double) representing the y-components of the forces on each atom.
- `force_z`: updated array of `nAtoms` elements of type `TYPE` (double) representing the z-components of the forces on each atom.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:

- `TYPE`: a type definition for `double` precision floating-point numbers.
- `nAtoms`: a constant integer value representing the number of atoms in the system (256).
- `maxNeighbors`: a constant integer value representing the maximum number of neighbors for each atom (16).
- `lj1` and `lj2`: constant values representing the Lennard-Jones coefficients.

Sub-Components:

- `loop_i`: a loop that iterates over each atom in the system, computing the forces between the current atom and its neighbors.
- `loop_j`: a nested loop that iterates over each neighbor of the current atom, computing the distance and force between the two atoms.
- `force calculation`: a component that computes the force between two atoms based on the Lennard-Jones potential.
- `force update`: a component that updates the forces on each atom based on the computed forces from its neighbors.
