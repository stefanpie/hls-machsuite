## stencil_stencil3d

An implementation of a 3D stencil computation algorithm, as described in the paper "Stencil computation optimization and auto-tuning on state-of-the-art multicore architectures" by K. Datta et al. The kernel takes a 3D array of input values, applies a stencil operation to each element, and produces a 3D array of output values. The stencil operation involves computing a weighted sum of neighboring elements, where the weights are stored in a coefficient array. The kernel also handles boundary conditions by filling the output array with original values at the boundaries.

Top-Level Function: `stencil3d`

Inputs:

- `C`: a 1D array of two coefficients, `C[0]` and `C[1]`, of type `int32_t`, used for weighting the stencil operation.
- `orig`: a 3D array of input values, of size `SIZE` (row_size x col_size x height_size), of type `int32_t`, representing the original data.
- `sol`: a 3D array of output values, of size `SIZE` (row_size x col_size x height_size), of type `int32_t`, representing the solution.

Outputs:

- `sol`: the 3D array of output values, of size `SIZE` (row_size x col_size x height_size), of type `int32_t`, representing the solution.

Important Data Structures and Data Types:

- `TYPE`: an alias for `int32_t`, used to represent the data type of the input and output arrays.
- `SIZE`: a constant representing the total size of the 3D array, computed as `row_size * col_size * height_size`.
- `INDX`: a macro used to compute the index of an element in the 3D array, given its row, column, and height indices.

Sub-Components:

- Boundary condition handling: a set of nested loops that fill the output array with original values at the boundaries.
- Stencil computation: a set of nested loops that apply the stencil operation to each element of the input array, using the coefficient array and the original values.
